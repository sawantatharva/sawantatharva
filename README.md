- Hello, I'm Atharva Sawant, a sophomore at Plaksha University majoring in Biological Systems Engineering with a minor in Data Science, Economics, and Business. Originally from Pune, India, I am fascinated by incredible breakthroughs in Computational Neuroscience, Genetics, Investment Banking, and Venture Capital.
- Ideas are meant to be explored and pursued by anyone, and as a student and an(in-process) entrepreneur, I don't want to limit myself to a specific niche in the industry. Instead, I want to build a comprehensive portfolio of ventures that can make a difference and be giant pioneers in their respective fields. This is why I started Serene in the first place, despite being a BSE student.
- I'm currently building Serene, a financial technology company â€” focused on helping early ventures to control their finances and grow by connecting them to precise opportunities, currently, I'm learning and mostly exploring things as it's Co-Founder.
- In the future, I'm excited to build and expand these businesses across a variety of industries and to keep making a difference.
- If you have any relevant opportunities that can help me grow & match my interests as well as my profile, feel free to contact me via email at atharva.sawant@plaksha.edu.in. And, If you would like to work with me or collaborate with any of the organisations that I am currently a part of, drop me a message (@thrvswnt) or keep an eye out for me at www.atharvasawant.com.
